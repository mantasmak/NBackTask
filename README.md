# NBackTask
In the N-Back task, participants are presented a sequence of stimuli one-by-one. 
For each stimulus, they need to decide if the current stimulus is the same as the one presented N trials ago.
The N can be 1 trials, 2 trials, 3 trials, etc. The higher the number, the more difficult the task.
